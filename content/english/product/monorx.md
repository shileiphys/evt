## Overview

Monorx is an ultra-portable handheld autorefractor prototype we have developed to bring low cost, fast and accurate eye exam for personal self-testing at home. It tests each eye in 10 seconds and reports refraction readings in the companion mobile app. We are also working cloud services for telehealth integration.
