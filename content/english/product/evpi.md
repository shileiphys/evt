## Overview

EVPi is a customized Raspberry Pi Computer Module 3 IO board. It has two crucial features that was missing from the reference CM3IO board but essential to many IoT embedded uses: wireless connectivity and battery support. The onboard Ralink RT5370 chipset supports 802.11 b/g/n with speed up to 150Mbps. You can switch the soft AP mode the same as described in the official instruction. The optional external antenna makes it specially versatile when a metal casing is required. EVPi offers a JST connector, once connected to a LiPo Battery, you can use the onboard PCF8563 for real-time clock.

EVPi also features a DRV8834 low-voltage stepper motor driver and 7-ports constant current LEDs output. It supports commonly OLED display and the underlining I2C bus can be connected for other uses too. The micro-HDMI can be very useful when developing software, and the little buzzer can come handy when you want generate some intention.
